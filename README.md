# What is this?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Divi Extension](https://github.com/elegantthemes/create-divi-extension).

Yeah, but le me tell you a couple of things.

First I want to say that I love Divi, and that's why I think it's stupid not to have less-than-great documentation for developers and not to keep the development tools up to date.

For what fucking reason I have to use such a complex and articulated stack of technologies (Node.js, Docker, Sass... ) just to make a poor fucking scaffolding of folders to create an extension? Just use GitHub, holy shit.

If you need to update the scaffolding to reflect any Divi update, just update the repository and fucking tag it.

Node.js with that fucking node_modules folder that finishes the inodes of a filesystem is a tool that doesn't make a fucking sense and using it should be prohibited by law.

That's why I thought I'd release a fucking pre-made scaffolding, as it comes out of the create-divi-extension tool after tens of megabytes downloaded and at least 15 fucking minutes of processing on a 12 core machine, for no fucking reason.

If NASA used this crap to put a man on the moon, Armstrong would still be there downloading the node_modules folder.

And anyway I wasted a fucking afternoon figuring out that we needed a version of Node dating back to the Mesozoic (14) to run this cursed tool (create-divi-extension) evidently updated when Bill Gates was still trolling Steve Jobs with Windows. Ah no, there wasn't that Node.js crap back then.

I hope whoever invented these technologies goes to hell to remake all this crap with assembly language.
